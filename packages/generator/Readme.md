# zod-prisma-types

`zod-prisma-types` is a generator for [prisma](www.prisma.io) that generates [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schemas from your prisma models. This includes schemas of model, enums, inputTypes, argTypes, filters and so on. It also provides options to write advanced zod validators directly in the prisma schema comments.

To find out more please [read the documentation](https://github.com/chrishoermann/zod-prisma-types/blob/master/Readme.md)
